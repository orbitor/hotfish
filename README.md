Embedded application toolkit.

Ever wish for portable:

* Message queues
* Pub/Sub Management
* Hash tables
* Arrays
* Stacks
* Lists
* UTF-8 Aware Strings
* Geometry
* Basic User Interface
* Multiple Language Support
* OpenGL Interface

Written in standard C without the overhead and complexity of C++ and
the STL? That is scalable from ThreadX to Linux? That won't get in your
way or change your work flow or add unnecessary bloat to your code base?
