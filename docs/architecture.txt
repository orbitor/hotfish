Don't be silly, painful is better.

"Brevity is the by-product of vigor"
            -- e.b. white

class HfViewController : public HfObject
{
    public:
        HfViewController(HfObject *View);
        virtual ~HfViewController();

        /* yadda yadda yadda */
};

C++ has no style. It once had promise, but has become gooey, gangly, and
kind of gross. It has been coerced into work for which it was originally
unintended. Like using a pick-axe to mow the lawn. It is brutish and
ugly, and often requires of the user far more work than originally
anticipated.

So much for a vision statement.

Implementing hotfish in C is not going to be easy and will not make for
beautiful code, either. But, everything should be clear to the user. And,
for my money, clarity is beauty.

Not alot of tricks -- hey, look how smart I am, cause I'm not -- just a
simple design pattern.

Structures are objects
Protocols are structures
Functions are protocols
Codes are functions
Statements are code
Syntax is tea leaves

Pancakes are love.
